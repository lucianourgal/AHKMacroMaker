# AHKMacroMaker
 This software was developed around 2015 using Java and has very specific use. However, its a good example.<br><br>
 
# Input Data
Its input is based on a sheet containg students data retrieved from a old academic system.

# Goal
The main goal was to transfer students registries from the old system to new one without doing that manually (and with access restricted to the new system front end only).<br>
The input fields positions were mapped to pixels so we known where we should click to set each value.

# Output data
Using the students data and the text inputs of the page, it creates Auto Hotkey scripts (.ahk files) so the student insertion into the new system is done automatically.
